## Components Used
| Reference | Component |
|---------|----------|
| U1 | Linear Voltage Regulator IC |
| R1, R2 | Resistors |
| C1, C2, C3 | Decoupling and filter capacitors |
| D1, D2 | LED indicators |

## Working Principle
1. DC input is supplied through connector J1  
2. Input LED (D1) indicates power availability  
3. The regulator IC (U1) stabilizes the input voltage  
4. Capacitors filter noise and improve voltage stability  
5. Regulated output is available at connector J2  
6. Output LED (D2) confirms regulated voltage
